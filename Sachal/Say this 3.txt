Generative Art:
Instead of a brush stroke you set up several logical rules 
to paint on the canvas. You logically describe what you wa
nt to see. I have handed out the code for these scenes,
and if you plug the code into a computer it will genuinely
work. Parts of may read like verse or poetry.

This specific work is not a music visualizer, or an
animation, it is more of a meditation on the song and the 
verse by Sachal Sarmast. So slow down, and try to absorb 
it, rather than watch it.

Thermal: [[HAVE AN EXAMPLE CUT IN YOUR HAND]]
This part here I'll tell you what it does, and we can talk
about why later.

This is a thermal printer, for receipts. It will be printing
what you see on the screen. Every few seconds the sheet will
cut and I encourage you to tear it off and take a look.

The screen is slowly going to 'count' through ALL the possible
words. Given enough time it will go through them all. Known 
words are highlighted.

There is also a code on each cut section, and if you figure it
out I will take you out to dinner.
